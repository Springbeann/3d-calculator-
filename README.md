# 3d-calculator-
This is a multifaceted 3d calculator that models a standard 3d graph, a point graph, and a virtual vector graph. Each graph uses one set of 3 user selected inputs, while the virtual vector graph takes an additional set of 3 inputs in order to create the 3d vectors. The goal of this project was to display the same data in three different forms with minimal effort.
